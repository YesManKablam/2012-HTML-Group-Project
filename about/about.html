			<p>He has performed extensively in both New Zealand (Aotearoa) and 
			Australia, as well as many countries in Europe, Asia and South 
			America. One of his more notable performances was at the Canaan 
			Downs festival in New Zealand.</p>

			<h2><span id="Teaching" class="mw-headline">
			<a href="#Top" name="Teaching">Teaching</a></span></h2>
			<p>Cosm has led workshops at the Boom Festival in 2008 and the 
			Rainbow Serpent Festival. Along with Pitch Black, Tom led a workshop 
			at Cargo in London on 24 July 2008.</p>
			<p>Tom is New Zealand's only Ableton certified trainer and assisted 
			Ableton with both the Australian (2009) and Israeli (2011) 
			certification events.</p>
			<p>Cosm makes and publishes online tutorials, providing the methods 
			and techniques for performing live electronic music. Cosm runs and 
			moderates a teaching website, based on the business model of 
			voluntary payment. Users are able to access a multitude of regularly 
			updated tutorials for free in standard, YouTube-style format, or 
			high-definition through a monthly subscription. All of Tom Cosm's 
			knowledge is given openly. The only real difference between material 
			given to those who voluntarily pay and those that don't, seems to be 
			the quality of video, and the fact that a student can download a 
			lesson in its entirety after subscribing.</p>
			<p>Each year he travels to Europe and USA, giving public and private 
			workshops.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2><span id="Releases" class="mw-headline">
			<a href="#Top" name="Releases">Releases</a></span></h2>
			<p>Tom contributed 1 track to the Compilation Contact Lens on Cosmic 
			Conspiracy Records , 2 tracks to the compilation Ultrapop 2 on 
			Fabularecords in 2007,and the Earthbeatz compilation on Native 
			Harmonix Records (2008). Tom has since decided not to commercially 
			release any more music, as making it freely available helps build 
			public recognition of his name, thus helping grow his performance 
			career.</p>
			<hr />
			<h2><span id="Distribution" class="mw-headline">
			<a href="#Top" name="Distribution">Distribution</a></span></h2>
			<p>Tom makes his work freely available through his website. He has 
			several live sets and tunes available for download. He also offers 
			the component parts of his computer compositions so that others can 
			download and see how they are created.</p>
			<p>In his own words "I treat music as a form of communication that 
			completely overpowers that of any other kind of human interaction, 
			and I don’t want money or middle men getting in between the link 
			that we create when you listen to my music, or have its access 
			restricted to people who can either afford it, or have the technical 
			ability to steal it. Everyone can download my music free at anytime 
			directly from the source where it was created."</p>
			<hr />
			<h2><span id="Personal_life_and_career" class="mw-headline">
			<a href="#Top" name="Personal_life_and_career">Personal 
			life and career</a></span></h2>
			<p>Tom was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, where he spent his 
			formative years. He left Linwood College (New Zealand) in 2001. 
			Growing up he was influenced by Happy Hardcore, Drum'n'bass and 
			Breakcore/IDM. He also cites that classical composers, such as 
			Sergei Rachmaninoff and Franz Liszt were large influences. He 
			studied towards a degree in music, specifically Jazz, at the 
			Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology, but left after two 
			years to continue his work with computers and music.</p>
			<p>Tom currently resides out of his suitcase as he moves around the 
			world performing and teaching.</p>
